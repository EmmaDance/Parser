Lab Assignment no. 4-  Parsing

    STEP 1: perform the parsing of an input sequence

     Input: - a context free grammar (the example from course)
            - an input sequence
     Output: the parsing tree corresponding to the input sequence or a message in case the sequence is not accepted.

Remark: Verify if the parsing method can be applied

    STEP 2: performs the parsing for a program written in your language (lab. 1)

      Input: PIF + minilanguage grammar
      Output: parsing tree corresponding to the program or a message for errors (error diagnose where it is the case)
